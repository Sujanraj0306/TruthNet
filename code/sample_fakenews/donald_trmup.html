      <p>
        In a stunning announcement this morning, former U.S. President Donald
        Trump declared that beginning May 1, the United States will issue
        100,000 new work visas every month exclusively for Indian citizens. The
        move, according to Trump, is aimed at "strengthening the strategic
        partnership and bringing the best minds to America."
      </p>

      <p>
        "India has always been a great friend, and we want the brightest
        engineers, doctors, and developers to come and help make America greater
        than ever before," Trump stated during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago.
      </p>

      <p>
        The announcement has sparked both excitement and skepticism, as critics
        question the feasibility of processing such a large number of visas
        monthly. Nonetheless, Trump assured that a 'fast-track' digital system
        will be introduced to handle applications efficiently.
      </p>

      <p>
        The decision is expected to impact thousands of families and IT
        professionals across India, many of whom have been struggling with visa
        wait times and restrictions in recent years.
